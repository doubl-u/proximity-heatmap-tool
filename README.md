# proximity-heatmap-tool-
Proximity Heatmap Tool generates interactive heatmaps where X marks attractors (highlighting nearby cells) and O marks repellers. The grid responds in real-time with color gradients, visualizing spatial relationships through weighted distance calculations. Built with vanilla JS for lightweight prototyping and spatial analysis demos.
